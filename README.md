## Bulb 
A customised brainstorming tool. 

It's functionality is derived from usual note taking apps and extended to enable better visual display of your thoughts and ideas while staying as simple as possible. (therefore: __A__ lmost __J__ ust __A__ nother __N__ otes __A__ pp)
One may notice a strong similarity with the Apple Notes App for a reason, as this is in my opinion one of the best notes applications out there, simply because it has the perfect combination of usability and simplicity. I use it all the time but for me it lacked a couple of very important features beyond ordinary thought documentation.

While you can write notes in the way you are used to it, Bulb offers two main additional features:

1. __Graph View__: You can switch between a note editor and a graph editor display where you can set connections between your notes. This should assist your work process in a mindmap way. While thinking about complex structures of any kind of information some of us (me included) have the need to get out a sheet of paper and visualise their thoughts and associations while thinking. _E.g. in a one man software development endeavor, during a more advanced writing process, systems analysis, investigation, information gathering, etc. you often find yourself in a situation, where you benefit from organising your thoughts in a map display or something similar, to see connections and change the perspective on the data, to minimise the efforts of your brain to do so and then focus its energy on the actual analytical thought process._
2. __Tagging__: Setting tags on the notes can assist that process as it allows to form any kind of categories on your data such as prioritisation, grouping, pointing out features, etc.

The idea for the tool originated from two motivations:
1. The troubles that come with higher expectations in working pace in the software development process as a single individual where you have to constantly ping pong your own thougths. 
2. The need for a prototype to test an idea for a bigger vision.

In addition to the two points mentioned above the following intentions of the project can be named:
3. Warm my programming skills up for a bigger project & potential business idea, after I had spent a year on developing hardware & working with flight controller software.
4. Create a software portfolio project
5. Practice my passion for working with all kinds of technology that orignated from the web technology domain.
6. Create a tool I needed myself, in the way I wanted to.
6. Fun.


## Usage
Bulb works based on projects, in each project you document your notes, and each project can have one project graph. 

Data is stored as JSON format in file databases which can be stored anywhere on your computer. 
This introduces the following advantages: 
1. If you have a project of any kind you can conveniently store all your note data within the specific project. And thus have your data all together. 
2. You can directly access and modify your data also without your notes application.

The only disadvantage: If you violate or destroy the JSON format of your database file, Bulb will not be able to process it..
