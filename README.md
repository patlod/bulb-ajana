## Bulb 
A customised brainstorming tool. 

It's functionality is derived from usual note taking apps and extended to enable better visual display of your thoughts and ideas while staying as simple as possible. (therefore: __A__ lmost __J__ ust __A__ nother __N__ otes __A__ pp)

While you can write notes in the way you are used to it, Bulb offers two main features:

1. __Graph View__: You can switch between a note editor and a graph editor display where you can set connections between your notes. This should assist your work process in a mindmap way. While thinking about complex structures of any kind of information some of us (me included) have the need to get out a sheet of paper and visualise their thoughts and associations while thinking. _E.g. in a one man software development endeavor, during a more advanced writing process, systems analysis, investigation, information gathering, etc. you often find yourself in a situation, where you benefit from organising your thoughts in a map display or something similar, to see connections and change the perspective on the data, to minimise the efforts of your brain to do so and then focus its energy on the actual analytical thought process._
2. __Tagging__: Setting tags on the notes can assist that process as it allows to form any kind of categories on your data such as prioritisation, grouping, pointing out features, etc.

The idea for the tool originated from two trigger points:
1. The troubles that come from expectations in work speed in the software development process as a single individual where you have to constantly ping pong your own thougths. 
2. The need for a prototype to test the idea for a bigger vision.
